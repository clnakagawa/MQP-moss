# Senior Thesis Project (Major Qualifying Project)
This project was completed as a graduation requirement at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The goal of the project was to investigate the role of Myosin XI in moss cell development, specifically tip growth. This was done by analyzing RNA-seq data obtained from mutant physcomitrium patens with a temperature sensitive Myosin XI variant. Results from this project were presented and evaluated as part of WPI's undergraduate project showcase. This project was awarded the Provost's MQP Award for outstanding research in the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology department. Poster presented at research showcase shown below.
